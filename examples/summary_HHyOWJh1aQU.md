# The Ultimate (Beginner) Programming Language Tier List (2024)

🔗 Video: https://youtu.be/HHyOWJh1aQU

## Summary

A tier list ranks the top TIOBE programming languages for beginners aiming to land their first developer job, emphasizing that market realities now demand deep, transferable skills rather than superficial knowledge. Low-level or overly niche languages (such as Assembler, Fortran, and Visual Basic) are discouraged, while a versatile, C–based language via .NET and Java shine for their strong enterprise presence. Although JavaScript remains essential for web development, its oversaturation makes it less ideal as a standalone skill, and languages like Kotlin and Swift offer targeted mobile opportunities. Meanwhile, PHP can open up gig work, but Python and Ruby are seen as less effective starting points due to their specialized roles in today’s job market.


## Takeaways

* **💡 Tier Criteria**: The video ranks languages based on how useful they are for securing your first developer role, focusing on job opportunities, learning curve, and long-term transferability.
* **⚙️ Low-Level vs. High-Level**: Assembler and similar low-level languages are interesting but not recommended for beginners due to their complexity and limited job prospects.
* **🔧 C & C++**: While powerful and good for learning fundamentals such as memory management, they are challenging for novices and usually require a CS background.
* **⭐ C (and .NET)**: Praised for its versatility, strong tooling, and ability to transition into various fields, making it an ideal first language.
* **🌐 Java & Enterprise Jobs**: Java is highlighted for its structural rigor and abundance of enterprise opportunities, even though it’s been somewhat overshadowed by newer languages.
* **🖥 JavaScript Challenges**: Despite its ubiquity, over-saturation and superficial learning may make it less ideal as a standalone first language.
* **📱 Mobile Development Focus**: Kotlin and Swift are excellent for aspiring mobile developers but might offer fewer opportunities compared to general-purpose languages.
* **📊 Data Science Specialties**: Fortran, MATLAB, and R are noted as specialized for scientific computing and data analytics, hence less suited for general developer roles.
* **💼 PHP & Gig Economy**: PHP may offer gig and contract work (especially with WordPress) and teaches solid coding structure, though it often faces industry bias.
* **🔒 Niche and Advanced Options**: Languages like Python, Ruby, and Rust have their strengths but may be less straightforward paths for beginners aiming at traditional developer jobs.
* **📈 SQL – A Must-Know**: SQL remains essential for many roles, especially in data handling, and should be learned alongside another primary programming language.


## Extracted Data

| Language       | Tier  | Key Insights                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assembler      | F     | Extremely low-level; very hard to use and not recommended for beginners.                       |
| C & C++        | B     | Powerful and close to the metal; beneficial for learning but challenging for non-CS graduates. |
| C# (.NET)      | S     | Versatile, enterprise-friendly with structured tooling; a great gentle entry for beginners.    |
| Fortran        | F     | Mainly used in scientific computing; not ideal for breaking into typical developer roles.      |
| Go             | C     | Designed for specialized large-scale infrastructure; too niche for most beginners.             |
| Java           | S     | High demand in enterprise; teaches strong structure with abundant job opportunities.           |
| JavaScript     | A     | Essential for web development but oversaturated; best learned alongside other languages.       |
| Kotlin         | A/B   | Growing in mobile development; transferable from Java though less widely used than Java.         |
| MatLab         | F     | Focused on data analytics/science; not broadly applicable for standard developer jobs.         |
| R              | F     | Similar to MatLab; specialized for statistical analysis, not typical for mainstream app jobs.    |
| PHP            | B     | Good for gig work and WordPress development; generally considered a step down from JavaScript.   |
| Python         | B     | Easy syntax with great libraries but more common in analytics than in traditional development.   |
| Ruby           | F     | Declining demand with low transferability; less ideal for beginners aiming at developer roles.   |
| Rust           | B     | Offers performance and safety like C/C++; challenging for beginners without a specialty background. |
| SQL            | S     | Essential for data handling in enterprises; a must-have tool even though it’s not a standalone job.  |
| Swift          | A/B   | Primary for iOS development; shares strengths with Kotlin for mobile but limited outside that niche. |
| Visual Basic   | F     | Legacy language; easy to pick up but not recommended as a first language for modern careers.      |
